=============
Magic 10 Ball
=============

This is a "toy" project fiddling with building B2G apps. Turns out
it's just like writing web sites and it was both pretty easy and
really interesting.


Status: May 4th, 2012
=====================

Ricky and I threw this together in a few hours one morning at a hack
half day during a webdev work week with no prior experience with Gaia
or B2G.

I'm not sure what the future of this project is. I might turn it into
a real app in the app marketplace when I have some more time to look
into that side of things.


Me too!
