Magic 10 Ball
=============

The magic 10 ball is your decision making system for superior decision
making.

But seriously, this is a "toy" project fiddling with building B2G
apps. Turns out it's just like writing web sites and it was both
pretty easy and really interesting.


Why "magic 10 ball"?
====================

10 octal = 8 decimal

for some reason, Will thought that was clever.

=====================

Ricky and I threw this together in a few hours one morning at a hack
half day during a webdev work week with no prior experience with Gaia
or B2G.

I'm not sure what the future of this project is. I might turn it into
a real app in the app marketplace when I have some more time to look
into that side of things.


Me too!
